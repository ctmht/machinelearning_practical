### WE SHOULD CHANGE THIS INTO THE REQUIREMENTS-LIKE FILE ###



To download libraries and other necessary stuff,
you need to type the following in your terminal:

pip install nltk
pip install --upgrade gensim
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
pip install keras
pip install tensorflow
pip install fastapi
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"



In the python shell (type python in the terminal to start):

>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('all')
(optionally) >>> quit()
